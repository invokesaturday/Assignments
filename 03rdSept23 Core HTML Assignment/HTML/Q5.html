    <p>5. Create a description list of full stack web development tech stack, using the < dl> tag. Each term should be
            a tech stack name and each description should be a brief explanation of what the tech stack is used for.</p>
    <p><b>Tech Stacks for Full Stack Web Development Described:</b></p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>LAMP</b></dt>
        <dd>An industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost
            efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:
            <ul>
                <li>Linux (operating system)</li>
                <li>Apache (HTTP server)</li>
                <li>MySQL (relational database management)</li>
                <li>PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dt><b>ASP.NET</b></dt>
        <dd>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very
            lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught
            the attention of developers all over the world. Now with .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about
            .NET Framework vs .NET Core.</dd>
        <dt><b>MEAN</b></dt>
        <dd>One of the well-known tech stacks, MEAN brings numerous benefits to web developers. Among these benefits
            are the use of a single language (JavaScript) and the underlying technologies are open source and free.
            MEAN consists of:
            <ul>
                <li>MongoDB (NoSQL database)</li>
                <li>Express.js backend web framework</li>
                <li>Angular.js frontend framework</li>
                <li>Node.js server-side JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            MEAN provides a practical approach to creating fast and highly efficient apps. All the components speak
            JSON (JavaScript Object Notations) for data transmission and free module library access. This tech stack
            helps to build scalable software products. It’s great for all types of websites and interactive
            applications.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>MERN</b></dt>
        <dd>Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.</dd>
        <dd>The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and
            servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
            Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user
            interfaces.</dd>
        <dt><b>MEVN</b></dt>
        <dd>Another variation of MEAN, MEVN uses Vue.js as the frontend web framework instead of Angular.js. Over
            the years, Vue.js has grown in popularity. It incorporates the best features of Angular and React.</dd>
