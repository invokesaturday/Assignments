    <p>1. Create a simple page with some div tags and show different ways to add CSS as well as what happens
        when you target the same elements with inline, internal, and external CSS. Also, utilize comments in the
        project where required.</p>

    <!-- This is first way of adding CSS which is called Inline CSS. the style is directly linked to the element below. -->
    <div class="container">
        <div style="color: red;">This is first div</div>
        <div>This is second div</div>
        <div>This is third div</div>

        <!-- Note: CSS priority is Inline>Internal>External.
        The fourth div is targeted with Inline, Internal, and External CSS. But since Internal CSS takes the highest priority, it'll render the color from Inline CSS. -->
        <div style="color: brown;">This is fourth div</div>
        <div>This is fifth div</div>
    </div>
